# Exploratory-Analysis-Covid19
Visual Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic with SQL and Tableau

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, causing widespread disruption and challenging healthcare systems globally. As data analysts, we have a unique opportunity to leverage our skills in SQL and Tableau to gain valuable insights from the vast amount of available COVID-19 data. Visual exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques allow us to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations, enabling us to better understand the progression and impact of the pandemic.

In this project, we will utilize SQL, a powerful database management language, to extract and manipulate COVID-19 data from various sources. SQL's flexibility and efficiency will help us query, filter, and aggregate data to derive meaningful information for analysis. We will then employ Tableau, a leading data visualization tool, to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate our findings.

By conducting a visual EDA of COVID-19 data, we can explore a range of insightful questions. For instance, we can examine the geographical spread of the virus, identifying hotspots and patterns of transmission. We can also analyze temporal trends, such as the daily and weekly fluctuations in cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities, to gain a deeper understanding of the disease's progression over time.

Furthermore, we can investigate demographic factors, such as age, gender, and pre-existing conditions, to identify vulnerable populations that may require targeted interventions. By analyzing vaccination rates and their impact on infection rates, we can assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Moreover, we can explore correlations between socioeconomic factors and the severity of outbreaks, shedding light on the broader implications of the pandemic.

Through this visual EDA of COVID-19 data, we aim to provide valuable insights and contribute to the collective knowledge surrounding the pandemic. By employing SQL and Tableau, we can effectively analyze and communicate complex data, empowering decision-makers and healthcare professionals to make informed choices and develop effective strategies in response to the ongoing crisis.

Join us on this journey as we explore the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of visual exploratory data analysis, utilizing the power of SQL and Tableau to gain a deeper understanding of this unprecedented global event. Together, we can unravel patterns, uncover trends, and contribute to the fight against the pandemic.
